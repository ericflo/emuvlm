# Test Coverage Improvement Report

## Overview

This report summarizes the improvements made to test coverage for the EmuVLM project, focusing on the LLMAgent component.

## Initial Coverage

* Overall project coverage: 31%
* `emuvlm/model/agent.py` coverage: ~14% (heavily undertested)

## Current Coverage

* `emuvlm/model/agent.py` coverage: 44% (significant improvement)
* Overall project coverage with limited test suite: 26%

## Added Tests

New test file `tests/test_agent_additional.py` focuses on testing specific LLMAgent methods:

1. `test_prepare_image`: Tests image encoding for API requests
2. `test_construct_prompt`: Tests prompt construction with system and user messages
3. `test_calculate_frame_hash`: Tests frame hashing functionality
4. `test_parse_action_methods`: Tests different action parsing scenarios
5. `test_query_model`: Tests the model querying process
6. `test_decide_action_basic`: Tests the main action decision flow

## Key Methods Tested

* `_prepare_image`: Base64 encoding frames for API
* `_construct_prompt`: Building prompts for the model
* `_calculate_frame_hash`: Generating unique frame identifiers
* `parse_action`: Parsing model responses into valid game actions
* `_query_model`: Communicating with the model API
* `decide_action`: The main decision-making flow

## Compatibility Challenges

* Some methods in the implementation don't match what would be expected from the code structure
* The agent.py implementation has evolved, causing mismatches with test expectations
* History and cache mechanisms are implemented differently than expected
* Some advanced features like summary generation are partially implemented

## Next Steps

1. Further improve test coverage for action processing and caching
2. Add tests for edge cases in parsing logic
3. Focus on testing the integration between components
4. Improve the agent's frame caching mechanism tests
5. Add end-to-end tests with mocked emulator and model responses
