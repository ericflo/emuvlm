  - "You control Lucas and his family and friends through a story divided into eight chapters."
  - "Battles are turn-based with a unique rhythm combo system - press A in time with the battle music for multiple hits."
  - "Use the d-pad to navigate, A to confirm and interact, B to cancel."
  - "Battle commands include Attack, PSI (psychic abilities), Goods (items), and Defend."
  - "Each character has unique abilities: Lucas learns PSI, Duster has Thief Tools, Kumatora has powerful PSI, etc."
  - "Enemies appear on the overworld; you can get a first-strike advantage by approaching from behind."
  - "Like EarthBound, you automatically win battles against significantly weaker enemies without entering battle mode."
  - "The game is known for its emotional storyline dealing with themes of family, grief, and capitalism."
