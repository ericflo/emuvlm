  - "This is Wild Arms for PlayStation, a JRPG with Western/fantasy themes and puzzle-focused dungeons."
  - "You control three characters: Rudy (with his ARM weapon), Jack (a treasure hunter), and Cecilia (a sorceress)."
  - "Battles are traditional turn-based combat where you select actions from menus for each character."
  - "Use the d-pad to navigate, X (Cross) to confirm, O (Circle) to cancel, Triangle to open the menu."
  - "Each character has unique field tools for solving puzzles: Rudy's bombs, Jack's lighter, and Cecilia's magic wand."
  - "Battle commands include Attack, Force (special abilities), Items, and Guard."
  - "The battle system uses a Force Point (FP) meter that builds up during battle to power special abilities."
  - "Rudy's ARM weapons require ammunition and can break if used too much without repair."
  - "The game features anime-style cutscenes and a distinctive Western-themed soundtrack with whistling."
