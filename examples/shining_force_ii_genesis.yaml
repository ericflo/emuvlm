  - "Battles are played on grid-based maps where units take turns moving and attacking."
  - "Use the d-pad to move the cursor, A/B/C to select and confirm (they all do the same thing), B or C to cancel."
  - "Characters have different classes with unique abilities and movement ranges."
  - "Between battles, explore an overworld and towns in traditional RPG style."
  - "Promote characters at level 20 for class upgrades (compared to level 10 in the first game)."
  - "The game is more open-world than its predecessor, with secret characters and hidden items to discover."
  - "Healing and support spells can earn experience, unlike many RPGs where only offensive actions reward XP."
