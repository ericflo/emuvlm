  - "This is Azure Dreams for PlayStation, a roguelike RPG with monster-catching and town-building elements."
  - "You play as Koh, a monster tamer exploring the mysterious Monster Tower to follow in his father's footsteps."
  - "The game uses a turn-based roguelike system where every action (moving, attacking, using items) counts as a turn."
  - "Use the d-pad to move, X (Cross) to confirm and attack, O (Circle) to cancel, Triangle to open the menu."
  - "When you die in the tower, you lose all items and your level resets to 1, but you keep any money and monsters."
  - "Capture and raise monsters using eggs found in the tower, then bring them along as allies on future expeditions."
  - "Monsters level up permanently and can be equipped with collars that grant special abilities."
  - "Outside the tower, use the money you earn to develop the town of Monsbaiya, building facilities and courting girlfriends."
  - "The tower's layout is randomly generated each time you enter, creating a unique experience with each expedition."
