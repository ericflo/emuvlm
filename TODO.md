- [ ] Refine model prompts for more accurate action decisions
- [ ] Optimize timing parameters for different game types
- [ ] Improve error handling for unexpected model outputs

### Enhanced Features
- [ ] Add frame caching for repetitive game screens
- [ ] Implement save/load functionality for game sessions
- [ ] Create more sophisticated game state tracking
- [ ] Develop better visualization for model decision-making

### Extensibility
- [ ] Add support for NES/SNES via RetroArch
- [ ] Create plugin system for easier emulator additions
- [ ] Support additional VLMs besides Qwen2.5-VL
- [ ] Build web interface for configuration and monitoring

## ðŸ”® Future Ideas
