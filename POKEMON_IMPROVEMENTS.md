# EmuVLM Pokemon Gameplay Improvements

## Summary of Improvements

We have enhanced EmuVLM to better handle Pokemon gameplay, specifically addressing issues with:
1. Loading screen detection
2. Context-specific prompting
3. Intelligent "None" action handling 
4. Pokemon-specific game knowledge

## Key Features Added

### 1. Automatic Loading Screen Detection

- Added `_is_loading_screen()` method to detect loading screens based on:
  - Number of unique colors in the frame
  - Standard deviation of pixel values
  - When detected, automatically returns "None" action without querying the model

```python
def _is_loading_screen(self, frame: Image.Image) -> bool:
    """Detect if a frame is likely a loading screen."""
    # Convert to grayscale for analysis
    gray = frame.convert('L')
    
    # Get pixel data and calculate statistics
    pixels = list(gray.getdata())
    unique_colors = len(set(pixels))
    
    # Calculate standard deviation
    import numpy as np
    pixel_array = np.array(pixels)
    std_dev = np.std(pixel_array)
    
    # Very low color count is almost always a loading screen
    if unique_colors <= 2:
        return True
        
    # Low std dev combined with few colors often indicates loading screens
    if unique_colors < 5 and std_dev < 30:
        return True
    
    return False
```

### 2. Pokemon-Specific Context in Prompts

- Added game-specific detection and context to model prompts
- Enhanced system messages with Pokemon-specific knowledge:
  - Battle mechanics (FIGHT, PKMN, ITEM, RUN)
  - Dialog handling (wait for text to finish)
  - Menu navigation patterns

```python
# Pokemon-specific instructions
system_message = f"""You are an AI playing a Pokémon game (Pokémon Red, Blue, or Yellow).
Analyze the game screen and decide the best action to take next.

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTION ABOUT POKÉMON GAMEPLAY:
- Press A to advance through dialog text and make selections in menus
- Use Up/Down to navigate menus, and Left/Right to change pages sometimes
- Press B to cancel or go back
- Press Start to open the game menu
- In battles, choose Attack, Pokémon, Item, or Run using directional keys and A to select
"""
```

### 3. Improved "None" Action Handling

- Enhanced logging for "None" actions
- Added specific delay handling for "None" actions in play.py
- Clarified when to use "None" vs. buttons in system prompts

```python
# In play.py - When model returns None
elif action is None:
    # Model explicitly chose to do nothing
    logger.info("Model chose to do nothing this turn")
    
    # Still wait a short delay to allow the game to progress
    delay = game_config.get('action_delay', 0.5) / 2  # Half the normal delay
    logger.debug(f"Waiting {delay:.2f}s with no action")
    time.sleep(delay)
```

### 4. Enhanced Test Framework

- Added Pokemon-specific testing options to test_llama.py
- Created script for easy Pokemon game testing (test_pokemon.sh)
- Added loading screen detection testing capabilities

## Results

The AI model now:
1. Properly detects loading screens and chooses not to act
2. Understands Pokemon gameplay mechanics (menus, battles, dialog)
3. Makes more intelligent choices about when to press buttons vs. wait
4. Can identify Pokémon game-specific UI elements

## Future Improvements

- OCR integration for text detection to further improve context understanding
- Battle state tracking to make more strategic decisions
- Pokemon roster recognition for team management
- Game-specific progress tracking to help guide the model
